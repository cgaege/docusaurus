# Introduction

**Health Discovery** is a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) platform for analyzing health data. With Health Discovery, unstructured medical text documents can be analyzed and searched for diagnoses, symptoms, prescriptions, special findings, and other criteria. 

Heterogeneous patient data in both structured and unstructured forms can be harmonized and analyzed by text mining, and can be accessed and searched via a unified interface.


## Healthcare Use Cases

### Clinical Decision Making

Medical errors are among the most common causes of death in Western countries. One of the reasons is the lack of relevant information at the right time. In the meantime, medical knowledge doubles every 100 days. Doctors can no longer keep all knowledge about diseases, therapies, drugs and their interactions in mind. The use of information technology is therefore indispensable in hospitals and medical practices. However, existing information systems are often isolated and health data cannot be systematically evaluated. A solution is provided by the use of artificial intelligence in combination with NLP (Natural Language Processing). Large amounts of health-related information from different sources and formats can be linked and analyzed. This knowledge can be made available wherever medical decisions have to be made.

### Real World Studies

The use of electronic patient data has a lasting impact on medical research. Routine medical data can be used to conduct retrospective observational and comparative studies. Much of the information needed in clinical research, such as diagnoses and symptoms, treatment history, functional values, etc., is often only available in free text. When this data is extracted from the texts and made available in a structured and semantically normalized form, many studies become possible in the first place, as many more clinical parameters are available, and more patients can be included in the studies.

### Coding & Billing

With the introduction of Diagnoses Related Groups (DRGs), the coding and billing of medical and nursing services has changed significantly. The documentation and coding of medical and nursing services is complex and prone to errors. At the same time, this is a very repetitive and time-consuming process since many patients with the same diagnoses are coded in the same way several times a year. With Health Discovery, missing codes and documentation gaps can be identified quickly and accurately. It enables an automated search for diagnoses and procedures and provides corresponding documents in the texts. You no longer have to manually process large amounts of clinical data and can concentrate on the essentials of your work.
